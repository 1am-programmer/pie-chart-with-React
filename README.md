# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


# React Pie Chart with Chart.js

This project demonstrates how to create a pie chart in React.js using the Chart.js library.

## Introduction

Pie charts are useful for displaying proportional distributions of data. This project provides a simple example of implementing a pie chart in a React.js application using the Chart.js library.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/1am-Programmer/react-pie-chart.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd react-pie-chart
    ```

3. Install dependencies using npm:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

To run the project locally, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser. You should see a pie chart displayed with sample data.

Customization
You can customize the pie chart by modifying the data and options passed to the Chart.js component in the PieChart.js file. Chart.js provides extensive documentation on customization options available for pie charts, including colors, labels, tooltips, and more. Refer to the Chart.js documentation for more information.
